This document tries to describe all responsibilities and tasks that are asked from SE Teaching Assistants.

**To (prospective) assistants:**
This is not meant to be a strict set of procedures or contract! 
Hopefully it will allow you to roughly grasp the tasks involved and see what is expected from you.
Workload might differ from TA to TA, week to week, but it should never be too much on average.
It is advised to use some form of [time tracking](https://toggl.com) 
in order to balance your workload fairly.

## Coaching
Every teaching assistant is assigned one team<sup>1</sup> to manage. For this team, your responsibilities are:
- Weekly meetings with the team where you update yourselves on their progress.
- Helping with any questions they might have relating the course.
- Motivating and supporting the team in general.

This does **not** mean you do their work! This is their project, you are solely there to guide them.

## Feedback and Grading
Every two weeks (the end of an iteration), you<sup>2</sup> will provide the team with feedback on their deliverables.
This feedback is meant to be:
- **Constructive**: Your goal is to help them improve and motivate them to do so.
- **Evaluating**: Give them some indication as to how well they are doing (but no grade!).
- **Inquisitive**: Do not feel afraid to simply ask questions, it will also force them to think about their code more thoroughly.

Code review is done by pull-request on github. Read the [Git Workflow document](/Git%20Workflow.md) for more information.

In addition to feedback, you will grade their work twice in the course: once mid-course, and once at the end of the course.
More detail about the grading and feedback process can be found in the [Grading document](/evaluation/Grading.md).

## Demos and presentations
Whenever a team has to present something for a grade, we ask all TA's to be present and to provide a review.
More often than not, the average grade will be used to combat the slightly subjective nature of powerpoint evaluation.

## Staff Meetings
In general, you will meet once a week with colleagues to discuss the course's progress 
and to update everyone on your team's situation.

## Basic tasks
Some other tasks that you might have to do:
- Make Nestor announcements.
- Input grades into nestor.
- Communicate with a client.

<hr />

1. A team generally averages to a size of 8 members.
2. It is preferred to have a second opinion, so try to arrange for another TA to review/grade the deliverables as well.
