# Software Engineering Course - Best Practices 
In the past years, we've been running the 
[SE course](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WBCS17001) at the University of Groningen, 
and we've found it to be a great success. 

This repo is here to collect guidelines, 
feedback, example documents and projects,
and support future iterations of the course.

If these materials will be useful for other
people, this would be even nicer.
