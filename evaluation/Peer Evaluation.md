To help Teaching Assistants determine parts of a grade dependent on a team's perspective,
we have constructed a small questionnaire. The TA will send this form to all students in the team, 
and will properly inform the student why they are asked to answer it.

This document describes the questionnaire below. It is advised to copy this document
to a form-service such as [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

## SE - [TEAM NAME]: Peer and Self-Evaluation
### Peer and Self-Evaluation
Use this form to evaluate both your peers and yourself for SE.

The survey has one section for each of you. Consider the sections with your own name as your self evaluation. For each grade give an example of how this person delivered work of high quality, or work of low quality, depending on the grade you give. 

Grading people is not required. If you really feel you cannot grade that aspect of the work that person delivered I would like you to motivate why (this shouldn't happen, as you have all contributed to the documents and all read them). 

Each question has a rating and a motivation part. In the motivation part explain why you think that rating is correct and give an example of a time when someone displayed that quality, or did not display it at all.
