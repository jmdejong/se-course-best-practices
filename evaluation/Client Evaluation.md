To help Teaching Assistants determine parts of a grade dependent on a team's client's perspective,
we have constructed a small questionnaire. The TA will send this form, and will properly inform the client why they are asked to answer it.
**Be sure to send it on time!** Clients might take a while to respond, and you cannot really
force them like you can do with students.

This document describes the questionnaire below. It is advised to copy this document
to a form-service such as [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

## SE - Client Evaluation Form
### Client Evaluation Form
This form is used to evaluate the performance of the team as perceived by the client for the course Software Engineering. You will be send
this form half-way and at the end of the course, where your answers will help us guide the students working for you.
We are very thankful for your reply!
