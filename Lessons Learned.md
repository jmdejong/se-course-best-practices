## Lessons learned from students past

# Team Work
- Do not take code-criticism personally, be professional and open for discussion.
- If somebody on the team is not producing any work, try to discuss this with them.
- Find out what kind of workflow works best for your team.

# Code Review
- Be constructive in code-criticism, but do not feel afraid to ask silly questions.

# Code Quality
- Extremely clever code is sometimes worse than simple code if they both will meet requirements.
- Try to be consistent in your code formatting.

- Long hours are not always equal to high amounts of productivity.

# Working with Customers
- Communicate with your client and target audience often and continuously.

# Dev Tools
- Productivity tools can help your team stay organized. 

# Reuse
- Re√Ønventing the wheel will usually not help, try to use libraries and frameworks to stand on the shoulders of giants.

# Version Control
- Sort out version control issues early on.

# Non-Functinoal Qualities
- "Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security" ~ AviD's rule of usability. Applies in select cases.

# Testing
- Tests should be deterministic
